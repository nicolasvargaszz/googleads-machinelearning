# googleads-machinelearning
a sample code of ML using python for google ads
# Importing the necessary libraries:

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection: Used to split the data into training and testing sets.
LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model: Used to create a linear regression model.
GoogleAdsClient from google.ads.google_ads.client: Used to connect to the Google Ads API.
Connecting to the Google Ads API:

The line client = GoogleAdsClient.load_from_storage() loads the necessary credentials to authenticate and connect to the Google Ads API. You would need to set up your authentication credentials beforehand.
Retrieving historical campaign data from the Google Ads API:

The retrieve_campaign_data function sends a query to the Google Ads API to fetch campaign data for the last 30 days.
The query retrieves campaign ID, name, impressions, clicks, conversions, and cost metrics.
The function loops through the response and stores the relevant data in the data list.
Preparing the data for training:

The retrieved campaign data is stored in a pandas DataFrame (df).
The input features (X) are selected as the 'Impressions', 'Clicks', and 'Conversions' columns from the DataFrame.
The target variable (y) is set as the 'Cost' column from the DataFrame.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets:

The train_test_split function is used to split the input features (X) and the target variable (y) into training and testing sets.
The testing set is set to be 20% of the entire dataset, and the random_state parameter ensures reproducibility of the split.
Training the machine learning model:

An instance of the LinearRegression model is created.
The model is trained using the training data (X_train and y_train) using the fit method.
Making predictions on the test set:

The trained model is used to make predictions (y_pred) on the test set (X_test).
Evaluating the model:

The mean squared error (mse) and the coefficient of determination (r2) are calculated to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and goodness-of-fit of the predictions.
Implementing the predictive bidding algorithm:

The predictive_bidding function takes the campaign ID, impressions, clicks, and conversions as input.
The function uses the trained model to predict the cost using the provided input.
You can implement your bidding strategy based on the predicted cost inside the function.
# Example usage:

* An example usage of the predictive_bidding function is shown with campaign ID, impressions, clicks, and conversions provided.
This demonstrates how you can use the predictive bidding algorithm to make automated bidding decisions based on the trained model.*
